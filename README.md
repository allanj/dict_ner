## LSTM-CRF Model for Named Entity Recognition (or Sequence Labeling)

This repository implements an LSTM-CRF model for named entity recognition. The model is same as the one by [Lample et al., (2016)](http://www.anthology.aclweb.org/N/N16/N16-1030.pdf) except we do not have the last `tanh` layer after the BiLSTM.
We achieve the SOTA performance on both CoNLL-2003 and OntoNotes 5.0 English datasets (check our [benchmark](/docs/benchmark.md)). 

### Requirements
* Python >= 3.6 and PyTorch >= 0.4.1
* AllenNLP package (if you use ELMo)


### Usage
1. Put the Glove embedding file (`glove.6B.100d.txt`) under `data` directory (You can also use ELMo/BERT/Flair, Check below.) Note that if your embedding file does not exist, we just randomly initalize the embeddings.
2. Simply run the following command and you can obtain results comparable to the benchmark above.
    ```bash
    python3.6 trainer.py
    ```

### Running with our pretrained English (with ELMo) Model
We trained an English LSTM-CRF (+ELMo) model on the CoNLL-2003 dataset. 
You can directly predict a sentence with the following piece of code (*Note*: we do not do tokenization.).

You can download the English model through this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N1DiS9Xhjprn4cfNvIgs9GWSHC47n25C/view?usp=sharing).
```python
from ner_predictor import NERPredictor
sentence = "This is an English model ."
# Or you can make a list of sentence:
# sentence = ["This is an English model", "This is the second sentence"]
model_path = "english_model.tar.gz"
predictor = NERPredictor(model_path, cuda_device="cpu") ## you can use "cuda:0", "cuda:1" for gpu
prediction = predictor.predict(sentence)
print(prediction)
```

### Running with your own data. 
1. Create a folder `YourData` under the data directory. 
2. Put the `train.txt`, `dev.txt` and `test.txt` files (make sure the format is compatible) under this directory. 
If you have a different format, simply modify the reader in `config/reader.py`.
3. Change the `dataset` argument to `YourData` in the `main.py`.


### Using ELMo (and BERT)
There are two ways to import the ELMo and BERT representations. We can either __preprocess the input files into vectors and load them in the program__ or __use the ELMo/BERT model to _forward_ the input tokens everytime__. The latter approach allows us to fine tune the parameters in ELMo and BERT. But the memory consumption is pretty high. For the purpose of most practical use case, I simply implemented the first method.
1. Run the scripts under `preprocess/get_elmo_vec.py`. As a result, you get the vector files for your datasets.
2. Run the main file with command: `python3.6 trainer.py --context_emb elmo`. You are good to go.

For using BERT, it would be a similar manner. Let me know if you want further functionality. Note that, we concatenate ELMo and word embeddings (i.e., Glove) in our model (check [here](https://github.com/allanj/pytorch_lstmcrf/blob/master/model/lstmcrf.py#L82)). You may not need concatenation for BERT.





### Further Details and Extensions

### Ongoing Plan

- [x] Support for ELMo as features
- [x] Interactive model where we can just import model and decode a setence
- [x] Make the code more modularized (separate the encoder and inference layers) and readable (by adding more comments)
- [x] Put the benchmark performance documentation to another markdown file
- [ ] Integrate ELMo/BERT as a module instead of just features.
- [ ] Clean up the code to better organization (e.g., `import` stuff)
